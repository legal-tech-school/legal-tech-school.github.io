    <h4>About me:</h4>
    <p>I'm a lawyer who decided to teach himself to code, because I'm a believer that technology
      can help bridge the access-to-justice gap. I work primarily in Python,
      but have also worked in Go and NodeJS.</p>
      <p>I'm constantly building and experimenting with ways to apply technology to law.
        Check out my <a href="https://github.com/samharden">github repo</a> for examples of what I've built.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to get in touch with me just <a href="mailto:samharden@gmail.com?subject=Hey!">email me</a>
      </p>
      <h4>My work:</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a legal technology consultant and I've worked with both law firms and orgaizations.
        Currently I consult with vLex, a global legal research company and Measures for Justice.
      </p>
      <h4>What I can do for you:</h4>
      <p>
        So you've got questions about legal technology. Maybe you're a solo / small attorney trying to figure
        out how to make your practice more efficient. Maybe you're looking for advice on product-market fit
        for a new legal technology service or gizmo. Maybe you need development help to scope out an MVP.
        Maybe you need help setting up Docassemble or creating interviews.
        Or maybe you just want to pick my brain about something.
      </p>
      <p>If any of those sound like you, just <a href="mailto:samharden@gmail.com?subject=Hey!">email me</a>
        and we'll find a time to talk. Disclaimer - I do charge for my consulting work but the first
        conversation is always free.
        </p>
