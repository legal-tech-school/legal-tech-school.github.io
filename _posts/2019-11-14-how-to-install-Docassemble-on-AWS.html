      <h4>The best place to run Docassemble is in the cloud.</h4>
      <p>Running Docassemble in the cloud means that you will be able to use it from any device, and you
        can write interviews that others can complete on their computer, tablet,
        or phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docassemble is free software, meaning you pay nothing to copy and use it.
        Running it on Amazon Web Services, however, does cost around $50-$60 (U.S.)
        per month.
