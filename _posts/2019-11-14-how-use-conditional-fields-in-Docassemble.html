      <h4>Level up your interview with conditional fields</h4>
      <p>Let's say you have an interview that asks the user:
        <ul>
          <li>Do you own a car?</li>
          <li>What kind of car do you own?</li>
        </ul>
        It doesn't make sense to ask them what kind of car they own
        if they don't own one...
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditional fields in Docassemble let you show or hide questions or
        fields based on the things your user selects. This video shows you
        how to use conditional fields in your interviews to make the experience
        much smoother and easier for the user.
