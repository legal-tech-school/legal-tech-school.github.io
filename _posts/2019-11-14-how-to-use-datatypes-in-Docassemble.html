      <h4>Different types of questions call for different kinds of answers</h4>
      <p>If your interview has questions about money, dates, numbers, and things like
        those, you should be using datatypes to make sure the answers from your users
        are the format you want. This video shows you how to use the different types of
        built-in Docassemble datatypes in an
        interview.
