<p>
	I made a little program that will let you build your own court forms by using a question and answer format in a browser window. The link to the repo is <a href="https://github.com/samharden/flask_court_form_maker">here.</a> This is the first part of the instructions that should help you get the initial build up and running. If you have any questions about it, or don't understand the instructions because they're badly written, please feel free to email me.
	
</p>
Table of Contents:</p>
<p>1. Initial Instructions (this page).</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://samharden.github.io/blog/understanding-all-the-parts.html">Understanding All the Parts.</a></p>
<p>
Detailed setup instructions for mac users (sorry Bill Gates afficianados):
</p>
<list>
<p>1. Open Terminal (in applications / utilities).</p>
<p>2. You should see this, but with your name, not mine:  Sams-MacBook-Pro:~ samharden$ </p>
<p>3. Type in "python" to see if you have python installed. If you do, it should say something like "Python 2.7.11 ... and then give a >>>> prompt. type quit() to get back to the command line. If you don't have it installed, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/ and follow the instructions there. </p>
<p>4. Once you have confirmed you have python / have installed python, you'll need to use pip - an installer module that makes your life much much easier - to install useful python modules. Modules are like little aftermarket add-ons that do useful things like connect to databases or calculate the time between right now and a date in the future. To use pip, simply go to your command line in terminal and type in "pip install _________" with the name of the module you want. Pip goes and gets it and installs it for you. It also lets you fell like you're doing cool hacker things.</p>
<p>5. To run this particular python script, you'll need all the modules listed in <a href="https://github.com/samharden/flask_court_form_maker/blob/master/requirements.txt">the requirements.txt</a> file. It's a pain, I know, but just type in "pip install Flask" and so forth. Yes, there may be modules listed in there that aren't completely necessary. Have a cookie. They're free and this is a stipped down version of a larger program, and I'm lazy. </p>
<p>6. Once you have all the modules installed you'll want a decent code editor. Either TextWrangler or Sublime Text are easy to use, so grab one or both of those. </p>
<p>7. Download the zip file of this repo. It's the green button. Top right. Unzip it into a folder off of your main directory , let's call it "Python."</p>
<p>8. Your file path should look somthing like this: yourname/Python/flask_court_form_maker. Make sure you've got all the files in there. You can open the ones that end in .py and take a look with your code editor of choice. The ones that end in .pyc are the result of python's compiler doing its thing. You can delete those if you want, [extremely haunty voice] but they always coooommmmmeeee baaaaaacckkk.</p>
<p>9. Want to run it right away? Great! Go to terminal. </p>
<p>10. Type in cd Python (This means "change directory to Python"). </p>
<p>11. Type in cd flask_court_form_maker. </p>
<p>12. Type in ls to see all your files in there. </p>
<p>13. See the one that is called run.py? Guess what that does. </p>
<p>14. Now type in python run.py. </p>
<p>15. You should see this :  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)</p>
<p>16. Go to your browser and at the top type in localhost:5000.</p>
<p>17. You should see the front page of the court form builder. </p>
