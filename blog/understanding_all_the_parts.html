<p>
	I made a little program that will let you build your own court forms by using a question and answer format in a browser window. The link to the repo is <a href="https://github.com/samharden/flask_court_form_maker">here.</a> This is the second part of the instructions that should demonstrate all the moving parts and give you a better understanding of what they do.  If you have any questions about it, or don't understand the instructions because they're badly written, please feel free to email me.

<p>
1. <a href="https://samharden.github.io/blog/court-form-maker-instructions.html"> Getting it Up and Running. </a></p>
<p>
2. Understanding All the Parts (This section).
<p>
Let's start out by listing all the (important) parts that make up our module:
</p>
<list>
<p>1. config.py</p>
<p>2. run.py</p>
<p>3. app/forms.py</p>
<p>4. app/views.py </p>
<p>5. app/__init__.py </p>
<p>6. app/templates/index.html </p>
<p>7. app/templates/base.html</p>
<p>8. app/templates/results.html</p>

</list>
</p>

<p>
You'll notice I left some of the parts out. This is because they're not really necessary to get into right now. 
</p>
<p>
You'll also notice, or should notice, that these files have one of two different extensions - the '.py' or '.html' that comes after the file name. This extension tells your computer what kind of file it is. The '.py' files are python scripts that run in the python interpreter, while the '.html' files are Hypertext Markup Language files that are read by your internet browser. These are what gives your browser an idea about what to display when you open the localhost:5000 connection. 
</p>
<p>
The config.py and __init__.py files are both small scripts, very necessary, and kind of boring so I'm not going to really explain what they're doing. Just know for now they're what gets your form builder up and running on your computer.
</p>
<p>
A note on indenting: you'll notice as you pke around in these python files that some lines are indented while others are not. Python uses indentation as a way of telling what lines are supposed to be run as part of a larget statement. Don't worry about that <i>just</i> yet, but if you're actually going through my code (as of my writing this a grand total of zero people have) you probably want to start reading the <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> tutorial as well. 
<p>
<b>Forms.py:</b>
</p>
<p>
Open up the forms.py file with your code editor. You should see 4 lines that begin with "from flask import" - don't mess with those. Remember installing all of those modules from the requirements.txt file using pip? These lines are basically telling python "go and get this module from tis place and bring it in here because I want to do something with it."
</p>
<p>
The forms.py file is where your forms are created. You should see two forms in there already - respondent and petitioner. Let's go ahead and create a third type of form. go ahead and type the following under the line with petitioner, indented the same way as the line about it:
</p>
<p>problem = StringField('problem', validators=[DataRequired()])</p>
<p>
Now you have a "problem" form you will be able to use on your form. But to get input and use the response on the form it's going to take a little bit more work. Go aead and open up your views.py file. 
</p>
<p>Views.py:</p>
<p>
The views.py file is what routes the forms you create in forms.py into your two web pages, index.html and results.html. Look down on line 12, where you should see "@app.route('/index', methods=['GET', 'POST'])" and 26, where you should see "@app.route('/results', methods=['GET', 'POST'])" Think of these two statements and what's indented after them as teling the program what to do on those web pages.
</p>
<p>
We need to add our "problem" form to both, so go ahead and type the following in on line 18, using the same indentation: "session['problem'] = form.problem._value()", and on line 32 type in "problem = session['problem']" These take your "problem form and route it to both pages. You're getting the problem input from the index.html page as a "session value" and then taking it over to the results page where you can then use it. Go down to the line 38 or 39 and add "problem=problem" after "respondent=respondent," but don't forget to put a comma after the second respondent or you'll throw an error. 
</p>
<p>Index.html</p>
<p>
Let's go ahead and get your new problem form up and on the interwebz, and by that I mean displayed on your index and results pages. Open up your index.html file. You should be able to tell where is is actually displaying the forms just by reading down the file. Look for the {{}} brackets, like where you see "What is your name? ... {{ form.petitioner(size=40) }}" Go ahead and make a new input form like the ones you see on the page. Here's an example:</p>
<p>
What is your problem? ... {{ form.problem(size=40) }}
</p>
<p> Do you see how the lines of text are seperated by those funny "< p >" things? Those are formatting signals in html to the browser, telling the browser how to display the text on the page. Play aroung with them and see how they work to space out text. What do you think the < br > one does?
</p>
<p>Results.html</p>
<p>
Now open your results.hmtl file. See how it's formatting the text to display the actual court form? Also notice how {{respondent}} and {{petitioner}} are both in there, and are where those inputs are displayed? Let's go ahead and add a {{problem}} in there, whereever you'd like, say at the first numbered paragraph, like so: "My big problem is {{problem}}"
</p>
<p>
Now that you've gotten that all typed in, run your program and see what happens. Remember that to run it you open your terminal, cd into the court form maker folder, and type in "python run.py." Play around with it some more and see what you can add to the program to make it customized.
