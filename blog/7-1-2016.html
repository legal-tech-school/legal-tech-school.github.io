<p>
Today is the first day of my new "gig," to use an overused phrase. For the past two years I have been running half of 
Metcalf Harden P.A. Today I am simply "Of-Counsel," so that I can spend the time necessary to expand <a href="http://www.mycourtcase.org">MyCourtCase</a> 
and turn it into a real, functioning, profitable going concern. I'm leaving my position at Metcalf Harden after two great years, 
and it's quite hard to let go. But I'm doing so because I think it will lead to bigger and better things.</p>
<p>
<h3>Ok, so <i>why?</h3></i>
</p>
<p>
A multitude of reasons:
</p>

<p>First, because I believe the concept of mycourtcase.org has value, both societally and in terms of 
"cash on the barrel." I'm counting on this to pay off. Maybe I've deluded myself into thinking that it will pay off, but 
trust me when I say that no one has <i>ever</i> accused me of being an optimist.</p>

<p>
Second, becasue life is short, and opportunities to experiment with something new get fewer and more far between the 
older you get. Maybe I'm conflating opportunity with ability, but you get the gist. Here's where we put that 
"ah! but x% of startups fail!" statistic people always bring up. That's true, but honestly I'm more worried about what 
happens if I don't try at this point ("FONT" I guess, instead of "FOMO"?). 
</p>
<p>
  Third, because, well, I think the legal tech sector is in its infancy and there's some really exciting things that 
  can be done, even though all the VC money seems to go to things like fitness trackers for gerbils. A lot of legal tech is
  geared toward selling shink things to lawyers and law firms, such as e-discovery or case management systems. There's a lot 
  of space, I think, for legal tech that serves the public and facilitates access to justice. It's thrilling to be working 
  on something in that area.
</p>

<h3>What's next:</h3>
<p>
  There's a lot of work that I've already done on this project, and a lot that remains to be done. I've done a lot of
   thinking and research on how to bring a startup up to speed and make it profitable and what to do and how to do it and 
   how to write on Medium about the San Fran startup scene even though I don't live in San Fran. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm planning on writing more here about what I'm doing and how I'm feeling about doing it. In a way it's therapy. Startup 
  people who describe themselves as "founders" are notoriously positive. I'm not. I'm not sure that someone who has suffered 
  from a form of clinical depression since childhood <i>can</i> be a "startup founder," but here goes.
</p>
  
<p>
  I will be writing more here about the process I'm going through in getting my startup off the ground. I'm 
  hoping to be as honest and transparent as possible about the process, what I'm facing, and what I'm doing.
